    "1. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deduction.\n",
    "1. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "1. Write your functions in this notebook only. **Do not create Python modules and import them**.\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. **Do not import anything else.**\n",
    "1. Your code must run without errors. Make sure your `numpy` version is at least 1.15.4 and that you are using at least python 3.6. Changes of the configuration we provided are at your own risk. Any code that cannot run will not be graded.\n",
    "1. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated.\n",
    "1. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown** cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support). Answers that will be written in commented code blocks will not be checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will perform the following:\n",
    "1. Practice OOP in python.\n",
    "2. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.\n",
    "3. Construct a decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "4. Prune the tree to achieve better results.\n",
    "5. Visualize your results."
