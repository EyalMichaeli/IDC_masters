    "# Exercise 4: Logistic Regression, Bayes and EM\n",

    "In this assignment you will implement several algorithms as learned in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "2. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deduction.\n",
    "3. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "4. Write your functions in this notebook only. **Do not create Python modules and import them**.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) and pandas. \n",
    "6. Your code must run without errors. During the environment setup, you were given a specific version of `numpy` to install (1.15.4). Changes of the configuration we provided are at your own risk. Any code that cannot run will not be graded.\n",
    "7. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated.\n",
    "8. Submission includes this notebook only with the exercise number and your ID as the filename. For example: `hw4_123456789_987654321.ipynb` if you submitted in pairs and `hw4_123456789.ipynb` if you submitted the exercise alone.\n",
    "9. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown** cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support). Answers that will be written in commented code blocks will not be checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will perform the following:\n",
    "1. Implement Logistic Regression algorithm.\n",
    "1. Implement EM algorithm.\n",
    "1. Implement Navie Bayes algorithm that uses EM for calculating the likelihood.\n",
    "1. Visualize your results."
