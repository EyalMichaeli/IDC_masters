    "A project management team want to model the number of two types of users, called type $A$ and type $B$, over time. The model they want to use has the overall number of users growing linearly over time. At time $t=0$ (not necessarily the website launching date) the linear model should have expected number of users equal in the two groups. At time $t=100$, they introduce a new feature. They think this could change the slope at time $t=100$ but only for users of type $A$ (it changes the *slope*, hence would not put a jump discontinuity into the expected number of users).\n",
